CPID,Name,Description
CP000,"Rebar (40,60,75,80 Grade Steel)","ASTM A615 describes grades 40, 60, 75 and 80 steel rebar made with low-carbon alloy steel.  Like all rebar, ASTM A615 bars can be made to be plain (smooth), or deformed (texturized to give the concrete more surface area to adhere to).  The standard allows for rebar to be manufactured in any process where resulting product meets minimum standards for composition and tensile properties.  Steel rebar is made from upwards of 95% recycled content."
CP001,Ready Mixed Concrete (Straight Mix) (NWC 3000-4000psi),"Concrete is a common construction material, used in many structural applications, and is highly customizable in composition. A “straight mix” concrete is made by mixing Portland cement, water, sand, and gravel, and can include chemical admixes, alone or in combination, to provide improved strength, durability, or other desired characteristic. This Common Product profile describes the straight mix in-situ/ready mix concrete composition likely to be used to produce normal weight 3,000 – 4,000 psi concrete for construction in the San Francisco Bay area. The exact amounts of all ingredients in concrete will likely vary to some degree based on the contractor, concrete supplier, and the materials used by the supplier to mix the concrete ordered.

The LCA excludes the environmental impacts associated with the use of admixtures, due to the high variation in the amount and type used across concrete mixes. To assess the potential influence this exclusion could have on the impact of the concrete, a scenario analysis was conducted with median amounts of four categories of admixtures: retarding, accelarating (chlorinated), accelerating (non-chlorinated), and water reducing/retarding. Results showed that despite the small contribution by mass (<1%), use of admixtures could increase the environmental burden. Eutrophication potential in paticular was affected, increasing the burden of concrete by as much as 17%. Primary energy demand also increased significantly, up to 7%, while global warming potential showed increases up to 4%."
CP005,Drywall (Natural Gypsum),"Drywall is ubiquitously used in building construction as interior wall enclosures, ceilings, and partitions in both load-bearing and non-load-bearing cases. There are many strains of Drywall including but not limited to acoustical, fire-resistant, moisture-resistant and mold-resistant varieties. This Common Product profile represents a regular Drywall product. Drywall is composed of gypsum plaster pressed between a paper or cardboard lining. The key material is gypsum (calcium sulfate), which is available in different hydration levels, and in anhydrous form. Natural gypsum stone is calcium sulfate-dihydrate (CaSO4*2H2O). The anhydrous calcium sulfate can be found in nature as anhydrite (CaSO4). Gypsum also occurs in large quantities as the industry by-product, otherwise known as flue-gas desulphurized (FGD) gypsum. This common product profile characters a drywall product made only naturally mined gypsum."
CP006,Drywall Joint Compound,"Drywall joint compound is used, along with drywall joint tape, to fill the seams between drywall panels.  It is also used to cover fastener heads and patch damage to drywall panels in order to create a smooth, uniform surface on walls and ceilings.  There are two types of joint compound: setting type and drying type.  Setting type (hot mud) is supplied as a powder and mixed with water on site.  It is a reactive plaster which limits the application time but decreases the time between coats.  Drying type is most usually supplied in ""Ready-Mix"" form, where it is already combined with water and must only be mixed prior to application.  This ready-mix, drying type of joint compound appears to be the most commonly used so is presented in this CP.  There are also many variations in the ready-mix category: all-purpose standard weight, light-weight, mid-weight, taping compound, topping compound, etc.  This CP is primarily focused on the all-purpose standard compound.  				"
CP008,Hydrophilic Concrete Joint Waterstop,"Concrete joint waterstops can be metal, hydrophobic or hydrophilic.  Hydrophilic waterstops are most common in joints with limited movement (concrete cold joints) and are thus explored in this CP.  Within this group of waterstops, bentonite clay based formulations are most common.  The waterstop is used in vertical and horizontal non-moving concrete construction joints and around through penetrations to prevent water intrusion.  The preformed strip watertop swells on contact with water, creating a seal in both hydrostatic and intermittent hydrostatic conditions.  Some of these strips are self-adhering due to their tacky nature, but most technical data sheets still recommend the use of a primer or adhesive (at least on vertical surfaces).  The material is delivered in a coil, with a paper backing on one side to prevent the strip from sticking to itself.  The paper is removed upon application.	"
CP009,Concrete Sealant,"Concrete sealants come in many formulations. This CP describes a type of water-based penetrating sealant based on silane chemistry, which is particularly suited to exterior and vertical applications. These sealants penetrate into the pores of cured concrete to seal them, as opposed to other sealants that may simply adhere to the surface of the concrete. Because silanes are a type of silicone, and silicone is inherently resistant to UV degradation, silane sealants do not require additives to achieve UV resilience.				"
CP016,Vapor barrier,"An under slab vapor barrier/retarder is employed to reduce the water vapor transmission through a concrete slab into the building envelope.  The vapor barrier is installed prior to pouring the slab.  Preventing excess vapor transmission through the slab is important to avoid damage to floor finishes or condensation that can cause mold and mildew.  The barrier also helps reduce infiltration of soil gases like radon and methane.  The terms vapor barrier and vapor retarder are often used interchageably, but a material is generally considered a true vapor barrier if the permeance is less than 0.01 perms as tested per ASTM E96.  Besides permeance, other important properties of vapor barriers are puncture resistance and strength - the barrier materials are often subjected to foot traffic and sometimes machine traffic on a jobsite and must be able to resist damage in order to function properly once the slab is installed.  ASTM E1745 requires a maximum permeance of 0.1 perms and describes the three classes of vapor retarders with Class A being the strongest material.  Under slab vapor barriers meeting Class A requirements are generally available in thicknesses of approximately 10 mils or 15 mils.  Often the 15 mil thickness will also meet the American Concrete Institute standard (ACI 302.2R) requirement of 0.01 perms or less ( a true vapor barrier), required for very sensitive flooring.  The vapor barriers are typically made of polyethylene, containing low, medium or high density polyethylene or copolymers of ethylene and α-olefins.  The sheets may be comprised of multiple layers, coextruded or crosslaminated.  Most typically, virgin polyethylene resins are used.  During installation, seams in the film must be overlapped by at least 6 inches and taped to ensure a consistent barrier."
CP017,Structural Steel (I-beams),"ASTM Standard A992 grade used for structural (I) beams was first standardized in 1998 and has largely replaced A36 and other grades ""because of its high yield strength and tensile strength, especially under seismic stress."" (AISC)"
CP018,Steel Bolt Assembly (General Use),"Steel Hex Cap Screws, Bolts and Studs for General Use. ASTM A449 describes bolts used for general engineering with tensile strength between 90 and 120 ksi depending on diameter.  The steel alloys allowed under the standard are heat treated to impart strength.  Two compositions of steel are provided in the standard.  Type 1 bolts are most commonly used and are the focus of this CP, while Type 3 bolts are intended for applications where resistance to weathering is a concern.  Based on previous research that galvanized and related coatings are typically specified only where corrosion is expected, this evaluation assumes a plain, unfinished assembly of bolt, washer and nut."
CP019,Steel Bolt Assembly (Structural),"Structural Bolts, Alloy Steel, Heat Treated, 150 ksi Minimum Tensile Strength. This CP evaluates a plain, unfinished assembly of bolt, washer and nut to be used for structural connections. ASTM A490 describes bolts used for structural connections with tensile strength between 150 and 173 ksi. Due to concerns about their making the steel brittle, ASTM A490 restricts the use of surface treatments.  Two compositions of steel are provided in the standard.  Type 1 bolts are most commonly used and are the focus of this CP, while Type 3 bolts are intended for applications where resistance to weathering is a concern."
CP024,Thin Film Intumescent Coating,"Intumescent coatings swell during a fire to encase a substrate in a thick bark of char, which protects the substrate from burning.  In the case of structural steel, the concern is that the steel will weaken in the high heat of a fire, rather than burning.  This CP describes intumescent coatings that are factory applied to structural steel, and intended for non-corrosive/non-humid environments.  These coatings are “thin film” intumescent coatings, and tend to be solvent-based."
CP025,Oriented strand board,"Oriented Strand Board (OSB) is a structural wood panel product typically used for sheathing (roof, wall and floor), I-joists and rim boards. OSB is manufactured by debarking and cutting wood logs into strands, which are then dried and arranged in layers of alternating orientation. The strands are then glued together with waterproof adhesives, typically a combination of phenol formaldehyde and polymeric methylene diphenyl isocyanate, and cured under heat and pressure. Panels are typically constricted in three layers with the central layer oriented at a 90 degree angle to outer layers. Panels are dried and treated with a sealant along the edges for moisture resistance."
CP026,Composite Metal Decking,"Composite metal decks are used in construction as concrete reinforcement and form. These decks are made from structural grade steel conforming to ASTM A1008 for primer coated or uncoated and ASTM A653 for galvanized coated steel. These coatings provide corrosion and rust resistance during construction. The standard galvanized coating is G60, but G90 may be used for high humidity and corrosive conditions and G30 or G40 may be used for greater economy. The base steel must meet have a yield strength of at least 33 ksi (SS grade 33), but may be available up to 80 ksi (SS grade 80). Steel decks are most commonly available in steel gauges of 16, 18, 20, or 22. This CP describes an 18 gauge composite metal decking made with 33 grade structural steel with a G60 galvanized coating."
CP027,Sub-Floor Smoothing Compound,"Subfloor smoothing compounds, or underlayments, are a thinned mix of cements, sand, and water.  The mix is poured over slabs and other subfloors and spread across the floor.  It naturally collects in low spots, resulting in a level and smooth subfloor once it has hardened."
CP029,Cementitious Grouting,"ASTM C476 delineates cementitious grouts into four types, each with a specific mixing ratio. Two types are made with self consolidating formulations which do not require mechanical processes for settling, but which are relatively new to the industry and less commonly used. The other two types are considered conventional grouts, and require vibration or other mechanical application to settle the grout into place after pouring. Conventional grouts can be made with fine aggregates only (a fine grout), or with a mixture of fine and coarse aggregates (coarse grout). This CP reviews a mixture of fine and coarse aggregates (coarse grout), which is suggested to be the more cost effective option and is typically mixed on site, but may also be available in pre-blended preparations, or as a ready-mix."
CP030,Liquid-applied moisture barrier,"Various products may be used as a liquid moisture barrier, air barrier, vapor barrier or some combination of the three.  These products can be in sheet form or liquid applied.  The advantages of liquid applied barriers include that they create a continuous, seamless barrier and are flexible to accomodate building movement.  This CP describes a one component, liquid-applied, water-based, air, vapor and liquid moisture barrier.  This type of barrier can be polymer based or polymer-modified asphalt based, the latter being described here.  These barriers are applied by roller, brush, or spray and may be applied to most common surfaces, including concrete, CMU, and sheathing panels.  Intended for cavity walls to be covered with an exterior finish."
CP031,Concrete cork expansion joint,"Expansion joints are added to concrete construction to absorb the small expansions and contractions that occur when concrete is exposed to changes in temperature.  Without expansion joints, the concrete would stress, crack, and lose structural integrity.  Cork expansion joints are one type of expansion joint.  Described by ASTM D1752 as Type II, they are made of “composition cork,” or small cork granules amalgamated and bound together with a phenolic resin, and treated with heat and pressure.  The joints are placed against concrete forms at predetermined intervals prior to pouring the concrete.  Cork expansion joints are recommended where a high level of resiliency is needed, and can be sealed with various expansion joint sealant products after the surrounding concrete has cured."
CP032,Flame retardant polyurethane foam window/door seal,"Fire retardant polyurethane foam sealant is a compressed tape of polyurethane foam, impregnated with an acrylic, fire retardant resin.  The tape is coated on one side with a pressure sensitive adhesive, which is protected with a release paper.  Upon installation, the release paper is peeled and removed from the tape, exposing the adhesive and installed, adhesive-side toward the window or door casing being fit into the building opening.  Once installed, the tape slowly returns to its original, uncompressed, state, thereby forming a tight seal around the window or door."
CP033,Firestop joint spray,"Firestop joint spray is used as a fire-rated sealant in wall to wall, floor to wall, floor to floor, head of wall, curtain wall perimeter, and other construction joint applications.  The dried firestop material remains elastomeric to accomodate use in both static and dynamic joints.  Generally, mineral wool is packed into the gaps and the spray coating is applied at 1/8"" wet thickness over the insulation and adjacent substrates.  The most common product type, water-based acrylic, is outlined in this CP."
CP036,XPS Insulation (extruded polystyrene),"ASTM C578 defines extruded polystyrene (XPS) thermal insulation as a, ""cellular plastic product manufactured in a one stage process by extrusion and expansion of the base polymer in the presence of blowing agent(s) resulting in a product which is rigid with closed cellular structure."" XPS foams fall into ASTM C578 Types IV, V, VI, VII, X, XII, and XIII. Rigid XPS foam boards contain flame retardants in quantities sufficient to meet standards outlined in the ASTM standard. This CP describes unfaced, rigid XPS foam insulation boards suitable for a range of insulating applications with a minimum compression strength of 40 psi."
CP037,Fiberglass Batt Insulation,"Fiber glass batt insulation is a thermal insulating product with high thermal performance, moisture resistance, fire resistance, and is sound absorbent. Fiber glass insulation is fabricated using a molten glass batch consisting of raw materials (sand, borates, soda ash, lime) and recycled glass cullet. The molten glass is spun into fibers and an atomized binder is applied as the fibers settle onto a conveyer to form batts which are then conveyed through an oven to cure the binder. Originally phenol-based formaldehyde binders were used, but concerns about indoor air quality led to the development and use of formaldehyde-free binders by all four fiber glass insulation manufacturers (Johns Manville first, then CertainTeed, Knauf Insulation, and Owens Corning). The entire industry switched to formaldehyde-free binders by 2015 for lightweight fiberglass products. Fiber glass batts can be either unfaced or faced with a Kraft paper, foil, or polyethylene film vapor retarder. Kraft paper facing is the cheapest option that meets residential codes in California and is the vapor retarder considered in this survey. Fiber glass batt insulation is installed by placing the batts into the wall cavity and stapling the facing to the framing members. Faced insulation should not be left exposed, but covered with gypsum board."
CP038,Chromate Pretreatment for Steel,"Chromate treatments are primarily used as passivation (corrosion reduction) coatings to protect newly galvanized surfaces which are susceptible to white rust. Chromium coatings may also serve as conversion coatings which prepare the surface for paint adhesion. Chromate treatments are typically comprised of trivalent chromium; however, that alone does not provide adequate protection. Therefore, conventional chromate treatments have included hexavalent chromium residuals that would act as a sacrificial anodes and create a ""self-healing surface."" While still available, regulations have moved the market towards coatings free of hexavalent chromium, using instead cobalt (II) salts such as cobalt (II) nitrate. Chromate treatments are appropriate for a variety of metal surfaces, including those consisting of zinc, cadmium, aluminum and alloys of these metals among each other and/or with iron or other metals."
CP039,Polyester Powder Coating,"Powder coatings contain five basic ingredients: resins, cross-linkers, additives (such as flow and leveling agents), pigments, and fillers. Polyester resins for powder coatings are often a combination of two or more polyester compounds and may be crosslinked with a variety of compounds; the most common being triglycidyl isocyanurate. While not covered in this CP, similar resins may be used to form hybrid powder coatings crosslinked with epoxies, which also comprise a significant portion of the powder coatings market.  Other additives such as flow and leveling agents, which keep bubbles from forming in the coating for a smooth a consistent coating, and fillers, are premixed with the resin and crosslinker, extruded, and ground into a homogenous powder. This powder can then be applied to various surface materials most commonly via electrostatic spray and oven cured."
CP042,Concrete Masonry Unit,"Hollow concrete masonry units (CMUs), commonly referred to as “cinder blocks,” are made from hydraulic cement, water, and aggregates.  The primary difference in composition between CMUs and in-situ concrete is its drastically reduced water content (known as low or zero slump concrete).  Further, because pre-cast products are cured in a controlled environment as opposed to changing conditions in-situ, the variety of admixes found in CMUs is much smaller.  CMUs can be made in normal, medium, and lightweights, but all CMUs have the same compressive strength and can be used for load-bearing applications.  Percent calculations are based on the density and dimensions of a normal weight CMU."
CP043,Aluminum Primer,"Aluminum is a difficult substrate to coat and requires a primer coating prior to application of a high performance coating.  A “universal primer” is a primer suitable as an undercoat for top-coats based on various chemistries (epoxy, polyurethane, etc.).  In the case of aluminum, the product most suited to be a universal primer is based on an alkyd resin formulation.  This CP describes a phenol-modified alkyd resin based primer for use on aluminum substrates, and compatible with various types of high performance coatings which would be subsequently applied.				"
CP044,Anodized Aluminum Curtainwall Extrusion,"This common product describes an aluminum extrusion, anodized with a clear surface coating, as is common in curtain walls. The aluminum alloys typically used in curtain walls come from the 6xxx series, more specifically 6063 in either a T5 or T6 temper. These tempers are chemically identical, but have been put through different heat treatments to impart slightly different strength and performance characteristics. Because they are part of a building exterior, extruded aluminum for use in curtain walls includes a surface treatment. Anodized treatments and PVDF coatings are most common for this application (see PVDF-Coated Aluminum Curtainwall Extrusion).  Anodizing is a process similar to electroplating, where electrical current is passed through a conductive bath in which the item being anodized is submerged. The current accelerates the oxidizing process that would naturally occur to the aluminum if exposed to the elements over time, and produces a surface layer of protective aluminum oxide. There are several types of conductive baths that can be used, but sulfuric acid is most common. Anodizing can include the use of added colorants and dyes to create a variety of colors, however this is a review of extrusions without added colorants. After anodizing, the extrusion must be sealed.  Boiling in deionized water is the simplest technique for sealing. The end result of the anodizing process is that the surface layer of aluminum has been chemically converted into hydrated aluminum oxide, which protects the underlying aluminum from damage. The dimensions of curtain wall framing are customizable. Based on a sample review of product literature, percentages are based on a segment of anodized aluminum extrusion 24 feet long, 2.5 inches wide, 6 inches deep, and .125 inches thick. For estimation purposes, we’ve assumed a simplified geometry and have excluded grooves, etc. from our calculation of surface area."
CP048,Elastic Facade Joint Sealant,"This CP is for elastomeric sealants for use in facade applications, expansion and control joints, concrete, masonry, EIFS, etc.  It is designed to maintain an effective bond and seal between materials of similar and dissimilar surfaces, porosities, and coefficients of expansion.  In general, a primer is not required for effective adhesion.  Both silicone and polyurethane sealants are used for this application.  This CP explores one-part polyurethane sealants.  The sealant is described as an elastic, low-modulus, one-component, moisture-curing, non-sag, polyurethane sealant.  Materials meet or exceed ASTM C 920, Type S, Grade NS, Class 25, Use NT, M, A, and O."
CP051,IGU Silicone Sealant,"Silicone sealants are used as a secondary seal in dual seal insulated glass units (IGU). Most commonly single component products that do not require mixing, these sealants are based on a ""siloxane"" chemical structure of silicone and oxygen bonds, that cure to form a hardened but still flexible seal. While the primary seal in the IGU serves to contain the insulating gas/air between the panes of glass, the secondary seal provides structural support, holding the IGU together as a unit."
CP053,Curtain wall seals - Rubber (ethylene propylene diene monomer) gasket,"Ethylene/propylene/diene terpolymer (EPDM) is frequently used to make curtainwall gaskets, which form a seal between the window portion of a curtainwall and the aluminum frame. This gasket is not adhered to the glass or the framing in order to allow for shifts and expansions due to temperature change. The seal between the glass and frame is therefore not water-tight, and curtainwall frames and gaskets can be designed in various shapes and/or include draining holes to properly direct rain water and prevent water damage to interiors."
CP056,Double Pane IGU,"Insulated glass units (IGUs) designed for commercial applications can be made with a variety of glass types, specialty coatings, and spacer materials.  This CP describes a standard IGU made with two panes of uncoated, clear, flat glass, an aluminum spacer filled with a molecular sieve desiccant, and assembled with a primary seal of polyisobutylene and secondary seal of silicone.  The space between the panes of glass is filled with air only. This CP does not include any framing materials, or products required for installation.   Calculations are based on a 1 inch thick 14x14 inch IGU."
CP065,Fluid-applied rubber asphalt roofing,"Fluid applied rubber asphalt roofing is made from a variable mixture of asphalt modified with rubber polymers, filler, and additives. The asphalt is sold at room temperature in solid bricks or disks that are heated in a kettle at the job site until melted to a specific temperature. Workers then apply the hot liquid asphalt to the roofing substrate, which forms a seamless monolithic membrane that seals the roof. Depending on the roof design, stone or other layers can be added to form a built-up roof, or the asphalt layer could be the foundation for a living roof of plants. This CP describes the hot applied polymer-modified asphalt composition only."
CP069,Roof edge flashing,"Roof edge flashing is a system used with membrane roofing to hold the membrane in place at the edge of the roof.  The flashing system consists of a continuous cleat (base plate, retainer) that is mechanically fastened to the roof over the edge of the membrane. The continuous cleat can be made of galvanized steel, aluminum, stainless steel, or Galvalume.  Over the cleat, a snap on fascia piece is installed.  This piece provides the finished look and can be made of galvanized steel, Galvalume, stainless steel, or aluminum.  The fascia can either be natural mill finish, anodized aluminum, or Kynar (PVDF) coated.  The most common system was found to be a galvanized steel continuous cleat with an aluminum fascia piece where the fascia is Kynar coated.  The fascia is generally produced from coil coated aluminum sheet.  The Kynar coating system is baked onto the fascia at a high temperature, generally about 450F or higher.  Both the steel and aluminum may contain post-consumer and/or post-industrial recycled content.  The fasteners required to attach the cleat, fascia joint splice pieces, and any sealant needed for installation are not included in this CP."
CP071,EPDM membrane roofing,"This CP describes a single-ply roofing membrane constructed from Ethylene propylene diene terpolymer (EPDM), meeting a class A fire rating as described by ASTM E108 or UL 790.  Under either standard, these membranes provide the highest level of fire protection available for low slope roofs.  EPDM membranes are traditionally black in color, and are manufactured through a calendaring process that ensures the finished membrane, whatever the thickness, is watertight.  To install, the membrane is attached to the roofing substrate by a layer of adhesive.  The perimeter edges of the membrane may be secured from wind uplift by a layer of gravel and/or metal roof edging."
CP072,Exterior Door w/ IGU,"This CP describes a “Standard Half Glass” (G) exterior entry door, in dimensions derived from the Steel Door Institute. There are many configurations of exterior doors with an insulated glass unit (IGU) installed, but the G layout, Level 3 (extra heavy duty) door was cited by the Institute as a common entryway with varied applications. The CP assumes the door arrives on site with the IGU factory installed, and excludes any caulking, hardware, or other mechanics needed to make the door functional. The door is comprised of galvanized steel door skins, laminated to a polystyrene core with a polyurethane hot melt adhesive. The vertical edges of the door are spot welded and contributes no additional content to the door. The window portion of the door is comprised of a dual sealed IGU with tempered glass and the spacer and sealant materials established are as standard in the IGU Common Product (CP056). The window is held in place with a glazing frame and double sided foam glazing tape. A factory-applied primer is applied to all exposed steel surfaces."
CP074,Metal Ceiling Tile,"Metal ceiling tiles are very versatile and can be used to create unique and interesting ceiling effects.  The tiles considered in this CP are flat, lay-in tiles that would fit into a standard drop ceiling, to be used in place of a gypsum or mineral wool ceiling tile.  The advantages of metal ceiling tiles are their longer life and the minimal upkeep required as well as greater flexibility in design.  The tiles can be made of aluminum, galvanized steel, or stainless steel.  Aluminum was found to be more common in the United States.  Recycled content for the aluminum can range from 20-100%, depending on the manufacturer.  The tiles can either be bare metal with a brushed or polished finish, painted, powder coated, or laminated with another material like wood to give the desired finish.  When sound absorption is desired, the panel has perforations and a thin acoustic backing is factory applied.  Additional insulation can be used to achieve higher NRC ratings.  This CP covers a powder-coated aluminum tile for acoustical purposes with no additional insulation."
CP077,Steel Studs,"Drywall studs are used as the vertical support in wall framing and are typically made of galvanized steel. They are available in a range of widths, lengths and gauge depending on requirements for strength, height, impact resistance and sound insulation. This Common Product profile represents a metal stud suitable for non-structural wall framing and meets ASTM C 645 (Standard Specification for Nonstructural Steel Framing Members) which also includes a protective hot-dipped galvanized coating of (G40) at minimum. The characterization of the steel used in this product was created in compliance with ASTM A1003 (Sec 4, Paras 4.1-2m, Standard Specification for Steel Sheet, Carbon, Metallic- and Nonmetallic-Coated for Cold-Formed Framing Members)"
CP079,Drywall Screws,"ASTM C1002 identifies the screws used to attach drywall to steel studs as Type S: made from steel as described in ASTM A568, with fine threads, designed to be self piercing, and not less than .315 inches (8mm) in screw head diameter or .136 inches (3.45 mm) in diameter.  The screws have a flat, Phillips head, and are treated to be corrosion resistant.  This CP describes a 1 inch long #6 gauge screw."
CP081,Acrylic paint,"Acrylic paints can be used for both exterior and interior applications. “Acrylic” is a broad term that describes several polymers, and acrylic paint formulations vary from 100% acrylic, to a mixture of acrylic and PVC or styrene polymers. This CP describes a white, low-VOC acrylic paint, with a medium sheen (approximately Eggshell), that could be used for coating interior or exterior surfaces. The catalog of paint products reviewed for this CP was taken from the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which makes product recommendations with an eye toward preserving outdoor air quality. This CP does not include any tinting compounds that would be added to the paint before its application."
CP084,Drywall Joint Tape,"ASTM C475 defines joint tape as ""a strip of material used to conceal and reinforce the joint between two gypsum boards"".  This material can be paper or glass mesh.  This CP reviews the more commonly used paper type of drywall joint tape.  The paper joint tape, in general, has no adhesive of its own and is imbedded in joint compound."
CP086,Drywall Acoustical Sealant,"This CP describes a non-hardening sealant to fill gaps in wall, floor, and ceiling systems, preventing sound leakage to maintain STC (sound transmission class) ratings.  Sealant is designed to fill gaps around the perimeter, at unbacked seams, and around penetrations.  Material is applied with a standard caulk gun per ASTM C919.  The overwhelming majority of acoustical sealants for this purpose are water-based acrylic sealants, which was investigated for this CP."
CP089,Pipe Thread Sealant,"Pipe thread sealant is used to seal threaded pipe joints and lubricate and protect threads.  The sealant in this CP is a non-hardening, non-setting (non-drying) sealant with PTFE.  The non-setting sealant can be used in service where immediate pressurization is necessary and allows for easy disassembly of joints without damage to pipe or threads.  The PTFE contributes a low coefficient of friction which allows for tighter joint makeup with lower torque.  These sealants are used for threaded metal piping (including steel and copper) as well as some threaded plastic piping.  The pipe thread sealant can be used in a variety of applications, including plumbing and fire sprinker systems."
CP090,Steel Pipe Hanger,"Channel struts provide a steel track from which pipe hangers and other hardware are suspended or otherwise attached to support the weight of traversing pipes, conduits, etc.  A Clevis Hanger is a common and versatile type of pipe hanger designed to attach to a channel strut and was selected for this CP as an example pipe hanger likely to be seen in commercial construction projects.  Clevis Hangers are made from low carbon steel and are typically electro-galvanized with zinc to provide resistance to rust and corrosion.  While not included in this review, note that where a steel hanger will support copper pipes, a plastic coating will need to be applied to the hanger to prevent electrolysis between the two metals."
CP091,Solvent Weld Soil and Waste Pipe,"Soil and waste pipes together remove sanitary wastes from buildings. Typically made from unplasticized PVC, the pipes are “welded” together through the use of a chemical solvent that dissolves a small portion of the joining pipe and pipe fittings to fuse them into a solid piece of plastic. Referred to as “DWV” (drain, waste, and vent) pipes, these pipe systems are not pressurized as water intake plumbing systems would be, however most PVC pipes intended for plumbing are specified for and dual-labeled for either purpose.  Schedule 40 is most typical.  Neither ASTM standards or industry sources limit the composition of PVC for this purpose. The ingredients below are common in PVC piping made in the USA."
CP092,Copper Piping,"Water lines are constructed with Type M, hard temper copper alloy C12200.  Type refers to the thickness of the pipe wall; Type M is the thinnest of the types identified in ASTM B88.  The pipes are seamless and identifiable by a red stripe where trademark  and country of origin information is stamped.  California Building Code indicates that most solders referenced in ASTM B 32 can be used to join copper pipes for potable water systems."
CP094,Intumescent firestop sealant,"Intumescent firestop sealants are used to seal joints and voids in fire-rated assemblies, including around through penetrations such as pipes, HVAC ducting, cables, etc.  The sealant offers good adhesion to a variety of surfaces including metal, plastic, drywall, concrete, and wood.  The sealant contains fire resistant and intumescent materials to prevent the spread of fire and smoke through the protected joints and penetrations.  The most common material is water-based with an elastomeric acrylic polymer binder.  The material is supplied in tubes or pails for application with a caulk gun, trowel or putty knife.  While the primary purpose of these sealants is fire protection, they do also decrease sound transmission through the sealed voids."
CP095,Galvanized Steel Ducts,"Galvanized steel ducts are the most frequently used duct material for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in commercial and institutional buildings. Galvanized steel ducts may come in round, rectangular, or oval shapes of varying sizes depending upon the application. Galvanized coatings are applied to steel sheets through a hot dip in a 99% pure zinc bath, which reacts with the steel sheet surface to form a coating which protects the steel from corrosion. The HVAC Duct Construction Standards for metal and flexible state that duct work will conform to ASTM A653 and ASTM924 standards for G-60 coated galvanized steel of lockforming grade (also known as commercial steel (CS)), unless otherwise specified. When a CS type is not specified, ASTM A653 recommends furnishing to CS type B. The G in G60 refers to the galvanized (zinc) coating, while the number refers to the weight of zinc on the surface of the steel in inch-pound units. The most commonly used galvanized duct work conforms to G60 or G90. G60 is used commonly for dry indoor ducts while G90 is the minimum requirement for use in any outdoor exposure or wet indoor application. Therefore, most specifications refer to galvanized steel conforming to G90 standards. Ductwork is typically available in 18-28 gauge sizes, but gauges 22-28, especially 26, appear to be the most commonly used. Therefore, this CP describes a 26 gauge G90 galvanzied steel duct conforming to ASTM A653."
CP096,Carbon Steel Sprinkler Pipe,"Wet pipe fire suppression systems are the standard for most indoor spaces.  These systems load a network of pipes and sprinkler heads with pressurized water, ready to activate when heat sensors in the sprinkler head are triggered.  ASTM A795 describes the steel pipes used to create this network as being made from different “schedules”  (wall thicknesses) of steel, all with the same requirements for chemical composition.  The needs of a particular fire suppression system dictate the schedule of steel to be used. Steel sprinkler pipes can be galvanized at the customers request (at a price premium), but are typically provided with a “mill coating” of protective lacquer.  Corrosion to the inside of pipes is of significant concern.  Antimicrobial coatings aimed at slowing this corrosion are available from some of the largest pipe manufacturers in the US, so have been included as common in this review.  While all schedules of steel have the same chemical composition, schedule 40 pipes are most common and have been used to calculate dimensions."
CP100,Steel Conduit,"Electric Rigid Steel Conduit (ERSC) is defined by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association as a ""threadable steel raceway of circular cross-section designed for the physical protection and routing of wire conductors and use as an equipment grounding conductor."" There is no one ASTM standard for ERSC, but is manufactured to ANSI standard C80.1 and UL6. According to these standards, ERSC is produced in nominal 10 ft lengths, with threaded ends and one coupling attached. The exterior surface is protected with a metallic zinc coating or alternative protection coating such as PVC while the interior surface is protected with a zinc or organic coating, such as a polyester powder coating. In order to protect the newly galvanized zinc from white rust, an additional chromium coating, most commonly trivalent chromium, is needed. Chromium coatings may also serve as a conversion coating which prepares the surface for paint adhesion. Most frequently, many specifications referred to hot dipped galvanization along with a hot dipped organic coating.  Zinc and chromium coatings are assumed to be present on the interior and exterior surfaces of the conduit and polyester powder coatings are assumed to be present on the interior surface of the conduit."
CP103,HDPE Municipal Water Pipe,"High density polyethylene (HDPE) piping has been used in the US for potable water applications such as home plumbing and distribution mains as well as sewer and drainage applications since at least the early 1970s.  Its use is approved under AWWA C901 and NSF 61 standards.  Common newer resins have the designation PE4710 resin per ASTM D3350.  HDPE pipes commonly contain carbon black for pigment and UV stabilization.  They can additionally have a colored stripe to indicate the approved usage: blue for potable water, green for sewer, and purple for reclaimed water.  This CP is focused on pipe used in potable water applications.  Antioxidant/stabilizers are also included to prevent degradation of the polymer during processing and thermal fusion as well to protect from oxidation during the service life.  Some studies indicate that pipe additives, such as antioxidants, and degradation products may be found in water coming from the pipe over extended periods of time."
CP108,Type X Drywall,"Drywall is ubiquitously used in building construction as interior wall enclosures, ceilings, and partitions in both load-bearing and non-load-bearing cases. There are many strains of Drywall including but not limited to acoustical, fire-resistant, moisture-resistant and mold-resistant varieties. This Common Product profile represents a Type X (fire resistant) Drywall product. Drywall is composed of gypsum plaster pressed between a paper or cardboard lining. The key material is gypsum (calcium sulfate), which is available in different hydration levels, and in anhydrous form. Natural gypsum stone is calcium sulfate-dihydrate (CaSO4*2H2O). The anhydrous calcium sulfate can be found in nature as anhydrite (CaSO4). Gypsum also occurs in large quantities as the industry by-product, otherwise known as flue-gas desulphurized (FGD) gypsum. This common product profile includes a combination of natural mined gypsum, FGD, and post-consumer gypsum. Type X drywall has greater thickness and special core additives (mainly vermiculite, fiberglass, and kaolin clay) which provide additional fire resistance, higher rigidity, and enhanced sound attenuation as compared to regular ½” gypsum  board. 5/8” (16mm) type X North American gypsum  boards are manufactured to ASTM C1396, Standard Specification for Gypsum Board."
CP109,Drywall (Mixed Gypsum),"Drywall is ubiquitously used in building construction as interior wall enclosures, ceilings, and partitions in both load-bearing and non-load-bearing cases. There are many strains of Drywall including but not limited to acoustical, fire-resistant, moisture-resistant and mold-resistant varieties. This Common Product profile represents a regular Drywall product. Drywall is composed of gypsum plaster pressed between a paper or cardboard lining. The key material is gypsum (calcium sulfate), which is available in different hydration levels, and in anhydrous form. Natural gypsum stone is calcium sulfate-dihydrate (CaSO4*2H2O). The anhydrous calcium sulfate can be found in nature as anhydrite (CaSO4). Gypsum also occurs in large quantities as the industry by-product, otherwise known as flue-gas desulphurized (FGD) gypsum. This common product profile characterizes a drywall product made of a combination of naturally mined gypsum, FGD and some post-consumer gypsum."
CP110,Drywall (FGD),"Drywall is ubiquitously used in building construction as interior wall enclosures, ceilings, and partitions in both load-bearing and non-load-bearing cases. There are many strains of Drywall including but not limited to acoustical, fire-resistant, moisture-resistant and mold-resistant varieties. This Common Product profile represents a regular Drywall product. Drywall is composed of gypsum plaster pressed between a paper or cardboard lining. The key material is gypsum (calcium sulfate), which is available in different hydration levels, and in anhydrous form. Natural gypsum stone is calcium sulfate-dihydrate (CaSO4*2H2O). The anhydrous calcium sulfate can be found in nature as anhydrite (CaSO4). Gypsum also occurs in large quantities as the industry by-product, otherwise known as flue-gas desulphurized (FGD) gypsum. This common product profile characters a drywall product made of FGD."
CP111,Welded Wire Mesh Concrete Reinforcement,"Welded wire reinforcement is made from a low carbon steel suitable for welding.  Sections of steel wire of varying diameter are crossed perpendicularly with other sections of steel wire, and welded into a grid.  These intersections are joined using resistance welding which uses electrical current to melt the wires together, therefore no additional materials are needed to complete the weld.  Welded wire reinforcement is specified under ASTM 1064, however the standard does not require that any specific steel alloy or material composition be used."
CP112,Foundation waterproofing sheet membrane,"Below grade waterproofing products range from cementitious waterproofing to liquid applied membranes to sheet membranes.  The main advantage of sheet membranes is their consistent thickness. These membranes also have good elongation and flexibility to move with the building.  The most common sheet membranes are self-adhering rubberized asphalt membranes.  These products are often used to waterproof foundations and other below grade structures.  They are comprised of a rubberized asphalt adhesive which is laminated to a polyethylene film, with a release liner applied to the adhesive side.  The membrane comes in roll form and can be applied horizontally or vertically.  A primer is required on concrete prior to application of the membrane.  Once the membrane is applied, it must be rolled with a hand roller to ensure a complete bond to the substrate.  Some products have a selvage edge of asphalt adhesive to aid in sealing between sheets, but in order to ensure continuity, sheets must be overlapped by a minimum of 2-3 inches and the seams rolled to ensure adhesion. Some products may require additional sealing at corners or edges or additional protection from damage.  Care must be taken not to damage the membrane during backfill."
CP113,Foundation waterproofing sheet primer,"Sheet waterproofing membranes are used in below grade waterproofing for applications such as foundations.  While these products are self-adhesive, the use of a primer is required prior to membrane application on concrete.  The primer is applied to dry surfaces to condition them by binding dust and also providing a tacky surface for improved membrane adhesion.  Both solvent-based and water-based primers are available.  Water-based primers are more prominent and are recommended when priming below grade applications so are covered in this CP.  The primer can be brush, roller, or spray applied."
CP114,Foundation dampproofing,"Dampproofing products are typically asphalt-based and applied to the exterior of a foundation to prevent moisture from migrating out of the ground and into the pores of the concrete or masonry.  Many products recommend two coats be applied, either by brush or spray, 24 hours apart."
CP115,Granular Fill,"Granular fill provides support for a concrete pour. A mix of course and fine aggregates, the fill is placed under or on top of a vapor retarding membrane before being compacted.  Granular fill is specified based on the percentage of aggregates classified as course or fine based on size, rather than by material.  Aggregates can be mined from virgin sources, or recovered from the waste stream.  In California, both reclaimed concrete and asphalt are used in granular fill.  Because the precise composition will vary based on environmental and geographic conditions, this CP assumes that both virgin and reclaimed aggregates are used, with equal portions of Crushed Stone, Gravel, Sand, Blast Furnace Slag, Reclaimed Concrete, and Reclaimed Asphalt."
CP116,Plywood,"Plywood is constructed using thin layers of wood, called plies, bound by resin. A variety of wood species may be used depending upon the application. This CP is for flooring underlayment and roof and wall sheathing applications, which often use softwood species such as Yellow Pine or Douglas Fir. Plywood underlayment and sheathing is commonly constructed with a moisture resistant resin, such as phenol formaldehyde, and is typically sold in 4 x 8 ft planks of 9 mm to 18 mm thickness."
CP117,Particleboard,"Particleboard is a non-structural wood panel product constructed using wood residues from the production of primary wood products. Particleboard is produced by blending these wood residues with resin(s), resin catalyst, and wax followed by curing under pressure and heat. Urea formaldehyde (UF) resins continue to be the most cost effective and commonly used resins for composite wood products such as particleboard. However, due to formaldehyde emission regulations from the California Air Resources Board (CARB), manufacturers have begun to use new technologies such as formaldehyde scavengers - such as urea, melamine, and melamine urea formaldehyde (MUF) resin - to reduce formaldehyde emissions from UF resin. This CP models a particleboard product bound with a UF/MUF resin system."
CP118,Wood Framing,"This CP describes sawn lumber intended for light structural framing (wall framing, sill plates, etc.), also known as “dimensional lumber” in the industry.   Boards are cut in standard dimensions: 2x4 or 4x4 inches by 10 feet, are commonly used in framing, for example.  Because the lumber is intended for interior applications, it is not typically pressure treated.  Instead, the lumber is sawn from logs to the appropriate dimensions and air or kiln dried to 19% humidity.  To prevent discoloration, known as sapstain, from forming, dimensional lumber is routinely dipped in a bath, or sprayed with a fungicidal treatment that inhibits the growth of microbes naturally found in freshly cut timber."
CP119,Fire-retardant Treated/PT Lumber,"To become fire retardant, lumber is soaked in a treatment bath of water and additives, under pressure, until the bath solution has permeated the structure of the wood.  The bath is drained and the wood is dried to a 19% maximum humidity level, leaving the additives behind in the cells of the wood.  Fire retardant lumber (FRT) is rated for either interior applications (UFCA rated by the American Wood Protection Association) or exterior applications (UFCB).  This CP describes UFCA FRT, intended for various uses – joists, partitions, etc – where the lumber will not be exposed to moisture or outdoor conditions."
CP120,EPS Insulation,"ASTM C578 defines expanded polystyrene (EPS) thermal insulation as a, ""cellular plastic product manufactured from pre-expanded polystyrene beads subsequently molded into desired shapes and sizes resulting in a product which is rigid with closed cellular structure."" EPS foams fall into ASTM C578 Types I, II, VII, IX, XI, XIV, and XV. Rigid EPS foam boards contain flame retardants in quantities sufficient to meet standards outlined in the ASTM standard. This CP describes unfaced, rigid EPS foam insulation boards suitable for a range of insulating applications."
CP121,Spray Foam Insulation,"Spray foam insulation (SPF) is a site applied foam insulation for residential, commercial, and industrial applications.  SPF is a two-part polyurethane based foam and can be used in place of other insulating materials like batt insulation (fiberglass, mineral fiber) and loose fill insulation.  SPF can be either open or closed cell and both can be used to create a continuous air barrier.  Despite its higher cost, closed cell insulation has gained larger market share due to its higher R value and vapor barrier characteristics.  Closed cell SPF can be used in various applications including interior or exterior walls, attics, foundations, HVAC ducts, etc.  Since these products are reacted and applied on site, special care must be taken to avoid occupational exposure to the isocyanates, amines, blowing agents, etc. that volatilize during the application process.  Special training is required for applicators of SPF, and there is a delay period before unprotected individuals can re-enter the application area. Offgassing from the SPF can occur for extended periods after installation.  There is continued debate on the definition of full cure for SPF insulation and the amount of time needed for harmful levels of emissions to recede is highly contested."
CP123,Mineral Fiber Batt Insulation,"Mineral fibers are manufactured by spinning a molten mixture of rock wool (derived from igneous rocks such as basalt) and slag wool (derived from blast furnace slag from the steel industry) into fine fibers. An atomized binder (commonly urea phenol-formaldehyde) is sprayed onto the fibers as they settle onto a conveyor belt in layers to form an insulation batt. When the batt has reached the desired thickness, it is conveyed into an oven to cure. A vapor barrier can be applied to the mineral fiber batt with an adhesive; however, this was found on only one of the mineral fiber batts in this survey and is not included in this profile. Mineral fiber batt insulation is a thermal insulation product that has high heat resistance, inherent resistance to fungal, mold, and mildew growth, and is water-repellant. It has a high insulating value and also acts as a good acoustical barrier. Because of its high heat resistance, it is sometimes used as a passive fire barrier. Mineral fiber batts are installed by cutting the batt to fit the wall cavity. Friction then holds the batt in place until drywall is installed."
CP124,Thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) membrane roofing,"Thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) membranes are made up of a block copolymer of polypropylene and ethylene propylene and additives for UV and thermal stabilization. TPO roofing membranes are constructed by sandwiching a woven polyester reinforcing layer, or scrim, with two TPO membrane sheets. Roofing membranes are typically sold in thickness of 45, 60, and 80 mil sheets. TPO roofing membranes may include up to 20% recycled content, depending upon the manufacturer, from post industrial scrap. Roofing membranes are sold in rolls which are applied via mechanical fasteners, site or factory applied adhesives, or loose laid with gravel. Membrane seams are heat welded and edges are sealed using tapes or sealants."
CP125,Polyvinyl chloride membrane roofing,"Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) membrane roofing is made up of two layers of flexible PVC surrounding a woven polyester (PET) reinforcing layer, or scrim. Flexible PVC is made up of a variety of additives including plasticizers, pigments, flame retardants, biocides, fillers and thermal and ultraviolet stabilizers. PVC Roofing membranes are typically sold in thickness of 45, 50, 60, and 80 mil sheets. PVC roofing membranes may include up to 10% recycled content, depending upon the manufacturer, from post industrial scrap. Roofing membranes are sold in rolls which are applied via mechanical fasteners, site or factory applied adhesives, or loose laid with gravel. Membrane seams are heat welded. This CP does not include installation products such as fasteners or adhesives, but characterizes the roofing membrane alone."
CP126,Membrane roofing adhesives,"Roofing membranes are adhered to roof substrates through a variety of adhesive products.  While individual products will specify particular adhesives, rubberized contact adhesives can generally be used with EPDM, TPO and some PVC roofing membranes.  Some low VOC products are available, however this CP describes the traditional solvent-based version of rubberized roofing adhesives, which have fairly high VOC levels (median across products reviewed is more than 76%).  The adhesive is rolled or sprayed to the roofing substrate, and potentially also on the back-side of the roofing membrane, and allowed to dry.  The membrane is applied to the roofing substrate and pressure applied, until a permanent bond is created."
CP127,Steel Door,"Hollow steel doors can be fabricated with many options depending on their intended use.  This CP reviews a standard duty, flush, hollow steel door intended for interior uses where thermal insulation is not a concern.  The Steel Door Institute considers this a Level 1, Model 1 door, which is not fire-rated, but is suggested for use in a variety of situations in commercial spaces.  The most common core in steel doors where insulation is not needed is honeycomb, a matrix of resin-impregnated kraft paper, which provides structure and acoustical performance.  The core is attached to the door skins with a rubberized contact adhesive before channels are spot welded to the top, bottom, and sides to completely encase the core.  All exposed surfaces are cleaned and receive a surface treatment to ensure paint adhesion. Then, a powder coat primer is applied to these surfaces to prevent rust.  Doors may be painted once installed at the customer’s direction. Calculations for this CP are based on a steel door with the dimensions of 86 (h) x 36 (w) x 1.34 (t) inches.  Knobs, hinges and other hardware required to make the door operational are not included in this CP."
CP128,Medium Density Fiberboard (MDF),"Medium Density Fiberboard (MDF) is a non-structural wood panel product constructed using wood residues from the production of primary wood products. MDF is produced by blending these wood residues with resin(s), resin catalyst, and wax, followed by curing under pressure and heat. Urea-formaldehyde (UF) is the most commonly used resin for MDF, however other resins such as melamine-urea formaldehyde or polymeric isocyanate resins may be used when moisture resistance is specified or a no added formaldehyde (NAF) resin is desired. This CP models a standard MDF product made with UF resin."
CP129,Acoustical Ceiling Panels (FGD Gypsum),"Gypsum acoustical ceiling panels are classified under ASTM E1264 as Type X and come in a variety of ceiling patterns. Ceiling panels are typically sold as 2x2 or 2x4 feet panels and are 1/2 inches thick. Sound performance characteristics of these ceiling panels are determined by the noise reduction coefficient (NRC) and ceiling attenuation class (CAC). The NRC refers to how well the panel absorbs noise, which can be as high as 1. An NRC of 0.5-1 is considered to have good acoustical ratings. The CAC refers to how well the panel stops the transmission of sound, which can go as high as 45. Gypsum may be obtained from natural as well as synthetic sources. Natural gypsum is mined, while synthetic gypsum is a by-product of flue-gas desulfurization, scubber technology utililzed at power plants to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. Synthetic gypsum use is typically reported as post-industrial recycled content. These products also typically contain a small percentage (around 5%) of post-consumer content, which is paper waste pulp used in the gypsum substrate's core and paper facing. Gypsum ceiling panels are constructed by combining gypsum, paper pulp (often post consumer recycled), lightweight aggregate(s) (such as vermiculite, perlite, and/or kaolin clay), and binder (typically starch) into an aqueous slurry. The slurry is then formed and dried onto a fiberglass matt and faced with paper and other materials depending upon the design and application. Due to its durability and cleanability, vinyl facing is commonly used. In applications where high moisture and mold resistance are required, such as hospitals or commercial kitchens, in addition to the vinyl facing a vinyl backing, edge sealant, and biocidal paints or antimicrobial solutions may also be applied. However, that application was not covered in this CP. This CP characterizes ASTM E1264 Type X vinyl faced gypsum ceiling panels made primarily from synthetic gypsum."
CP130,Acoustical Ceiling Panels (Natural Gypsum),"Gypsum acoustical ceiling panels are classified under ASTM E1264 as Type XX and come in a variety of ceiling patterns. Ceiling panels are typically sold as 2x2 or 2x4 feet panels 1/2 inches thick. Sound performance characteristics of these ceiling panels are determined by the noise reduction coefficient (NRC) and ceiling attenuation class (CAC). The NRC refers to how well the panel absorbs noise, which can be as high as 1. An NRC of 0.5-1 is considered to have good acoustical ratings. The CAC refers to how well the panel stops the transmission of sound, which can go as high as 45. Gypsum may be obtained from natural as well as synthetic sources. Natural gypsum is mined, while synthetic gypsum is a by-product of flue-gas desulfurization, scubber technology utililzed at power plants to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. Synthetic gypsum use is typically reported as post-industrial recycled content. These products also typically contain a small percentage (around 5%) of post-consumer content, which is paper waste pulp used in the gypsum substrate's core and paper facing. Gypsum ceiling panels are constructed by combining gypsum, paper pulp (often post consumer recycled), lightweight aggregate(s) (such as vermiculite, perlite, and/or kaolin clay), and binder (typically starch) into an aqueous slurry. The slurry is then formed and dried onto a fiberglass matt and faced with paper and other materials depending upon the design and application. Due to its durability and cleanability, vinyl facing is commonly used. In applications where high moisture and mold resistance are required, such as hospitals or commercial kitchens, in addition to the vinyl facing a vinyl backing, edge sealant, and biocidal paints or antimicrobial solutions may also be applied. However, that application was not covered in this CP. This CP characterizes ASTM E1264 Type XX vinyl faced gypsum ceiling panels made from 100% natural gypsum."
CP131,Acoustical Ceiling Panels (mineral fiber),"Mineral Fiber acoustical ceiling panels are commonly specified with painted (ASTM E1264 Type III) or  membrane overlay (ASTM E1264 Type IV) finishes. Ceiling panels are typically sold as 2x2 or 2x4 feet panels 3/4 to 1 inches thick. Raw materials typically include mineral fiber, produced from blast furnace and rock slags and coke, lightweight fillers like perlite, recycled paper, and binder(s) like starch and/or latex.  The raw ingredients are mixed with water and slurry processing additives, such as flocculants, defoaming agents, and surfactants. The mixture is spread on a woven fabric scrim if a wet-felted panel or on a metal sheet if a cast panel and dried. For mold/microbial protection, water-based latex paints and primers are applied to the front and back of the panel. Antimicrobials are commonly used in these coatings and core. For additional fire protection, clay filler may be added to the core slurry, but was not included in this CP. Mineral wool ceiling panels can contain over 80% recycled content in the form of post industrial recycled blast furnace slag, used to manufacture mineral wool, post consumer recycled paper, and post industrial and/or consumer recycled ceiling tiles. Blast furnace slag and recycled paper content were captured in this CP. This CP characterizes an ASTM type III painted mineral fiber panel with antimicrobial."
CP132,PVDF-Coated Aluminum Curtainwall Extrusion,"This common product describes an aluminum extrusion with a 70% PVDF coating, as is common in curtain walls.  The aluminum alloys typically used in curtain walls come from the 6xxx series, more specifically 6063 in either a T5 or T6 temper. These tempers are chemically identical but have been put through different heat treatments to impart slightly different strength and performance characteristics. Because they are part of a building exterior, extruded aluminum for use in curtain walls includes a surface treatment. Both PVDF coatings and anodization are common for this application (see Anodized Aluminum Curtainwall Extrusion). PVDF coatings are typically 50 or 70% PVDF in the resin.  The higher PVDF percentage offers superior weatherability, meeting AAMA2605 requirements.  Some PVDF powder coatings are available, but solvent-based liquid coatings appear to be most common. A two-coat system is outlined here (primer + PVDF coating), however, a clear topcoat is sometimes applied as well.  A wide variety of colors are available - specific pigments may have additional associated hazards and LCA impacts.  The dimensions of curtain wall framing are customizable. Based on a sample review of product literature, percentages are based on a segment of anodized aluminum extrusion 24 feet long, 2.5 inches wide, 6 inches deep, and 0.125 inches thick. For estimation purposes, we’ve assumed a simplified geometry and have excluded grooves, etc. from our calculation of surface area."
CP133,High performance coating (epoxy),"Epoxy High Performance Coatings (HPCs) formulated with solvents are used extensively as surface treatments to metals.  They can be applied directly to metal surfaces easily to provide excellent corrosion and chemical resistance.  Epoxies come in 2-part systems which are mixed in varying ratios to produce the coating: one part is a resin, the other part provides the activating agents that initiate the curing reaction.  The underlying chemistry of epoxies, reliant on bisphenol-A, makes water based formulations technically difficult.  While some water-based epoxy HPCs are on the market, they are not intended to be used on metal substrates, and do not provide the performance characteristics of solvent epoxies.  This CP reviews conventional, 2-part, solvent-based epoxy systems only."
CP134,High Performance Coatings (Acrylic),"Acrylic high performace coating (HPC) is the term for a wide range of enhanced protective coatings for both interior and exterior applications in residential or industrial settings. This survey focuses on site-applied interior acrylic HPCs that offer chemical, stain, moisture, and/or rust protection for a range of substrates (including prepared masonry, wallboard, metal, and wood). Acrylic HPCs can be solvent-based or water-based. Concerns over high VOC emissions from solvent-based coatings has made water-based acrylic HPCs the predominant form on the market; thus, this survey focuses on water-based coatings. Tinting additives can also increase VOC content. However, this survey focuses on white or neutral coatings since those colors were available across all the products surveyed."
CP146,Acrylic Flooring Adhesive,"Acrylic adhesives are common in attaching many types of flooring to a substrate.  Carpet backings, resilient flooring, and engineered wood flooring may all specify use of an acrylic flooring adhesives for installation. This CP describes a one-part “universal” acrylic flooring adhesive, designed to be used to install many types of flooring.  While left out of the CP for being more of a specialty additive, note that some acrylic flooring adhesives may contain flame retardants or additives to make them more resistant to freezing and thawing cycles.  Many acrylic flooring adhesives contain biocides to prevent microbes from growing where moisture may find its way between the underside for the flooring and the flooring substrate.  These biocides are most commonly held as proprietary by manufacturers."
CP147,Epoxy flooring adhesive,"Epoxy flooring adhesive is an adhesive used for adhering linoleum, vinyl tiles, rubber tiles, or rubber sheets to a variety of flooring substrates (concrete, plywood, existing resiliant flooring, radiant heating subfloors, steel, aluminum, and cereamic tile, among others). Epoxy flooring adhesive comes as a two-part epoxy (Part A is an epoxy pre-polymer resin base and Part B is typically a polyamine hardener/curing agent) that must be mixed by drill on-site. Most commercial epoxy flooring adhesives come in a pack with Part A and Part B pre-measured to the appropriate mix ratio. Adhesive must set for 12-72 hours after flooring is installed before it can withstand heavy foot-traffic or rolling traffic."
CP148,Polyurethane flooring adhesive,"Polyurethane flooring adhesive is an adhesive used for adhering solid wood, engineered wood, bamboo, parquet, and some rubber and vinyl flooring to a variety of substrates (most commonly concrete, plywood, prepared terrazzo and ceramic tile). It comes in two forms - a one-part moisture cure adhesive or a two-part adhesive that must be mixed together on site. This survey focused on the more prominent one-part moisture cure form. Moisture-cure adhesives use ambient humidity or water in the substrate to cure. Moisture-cure polyurethane adhesives cure more slowly than two-part polyurethane adhesives and must set 12-48 hours before they can withstand foot traffic."
CP149,Linoleum Flooring,"Linoleum flooring is a type of resilient flooring that can be applied with adhesive over a number of different substrates (concrete, seamless floors, tile, marble, approved wood, old resilient flooring, metal). It comes in 2.0 or 2.5 mm thick rolls or in tiles, although the 2.5 mm thickness is most common in commercial products. The linoleum sheet or tile is comprised of linoleum sandwiched between a jute backing and a factory-applied UV-cured lacquer. Linoleum comes in a variety of colors and the color runs through the entire thickness of the tile. This survey focused on white or neutral-colored linoleum; other colors will require the addition of pigments with different CASRNs and potential health hazards. After the linoleum has been installed most products require daily maintenance in the form of mopping, with periodic machine scrubbing and/or buffing. Some linoleum products also need to have polished applied a few times per year. If properly maintained, linoleum flooring will last 35-40 years. Most linoleum contains between 30-43% pre-consumer recycled content in the form of linoleum production scraps and recycled wood/cork powder."
CP150,Vinyl Composition Tile,"Vinyl Composition Tile (VCT) is a rigid floor tile widely used in commercial flooring applications and in small amounts residentially. VCT is commonly available as a 12 in x 12 in (305 mm x 305 mm) 1/8 in thick tile. VCT is composed largely of limestone with smaller proportions of vinyl resins, plasticizer, stabilizers, and pigments. These ingredients are mixed, heated, formed into a sheet, cut into tiles, and finally cooled before packaging. VCT typically has a factory applied acrylic finish to protect it through installation. Once installed, additonal layers of acrylic finish are added. Due to the small proportion of this finish within the overall product as manufacturered, this component is not included in this CP. Historically, phthalate plasticizers were commonly used in VCT. However, recently the market has phased out the use of phthalate plasticizers, making their non-phthalate alternatives more widely prevalent. VCT commonly contains some recycled content, typically at least 1% wt. of the finished product. This content may be post-industrial recyclate coming from other industries, post-consumer coming from manufacturer recycling programs or both. One manufacturer discussed the use of both recycle streams, while two others disclosed their recyclate as post-consumer VCT. This CP assumes a controlled recycle stream from post-consumer VCT, which replaces a portion of the limestone filler. This content introduces at minimum some residual phthalates while other recyclate streams, especially third party PVC scrap, could introduce multiple other hazardous residuals."
CP151,Fluid-Applied Flooring,"Fluid-applied flooring systems are durable flooring systems installed over concrete. They are strong, easy to clean, resistant to spills, and provide coverage for large spaces. Several types of fluid-applied flooring are available including methylmethacrylate and urethane, but epoxy systems are the most common and thus were the focus of this survey. Epoxy fluid-applied flooring is applied in multiple coats. Most applications start with a primer coat, followed by a body coat into which quartz aggregate or colored vinyl chips are broadcast. The body coat is followed by an undercoat into which the aggregate or chips may or may not be broadcast again. Finally, an epoxy or urethane topcoat is applied to seal the system. There was more dislosure for the composition of epoxy topcoats in the products surveyed and so that is what is presented here.  Individual coats of fluid-applied flooring systems, as well as the broadcast quartz or chips, may be pigmented but for this survey neutral or clear coats were selected."
CP152,Carpet,"Carpet products are commonly available as tile (aka. modular) and broadloom carpeting. Carpet products start as a yarn face, tufted into a primary backing. A precoat layer of latex, filler, alumina tryihydrate flame retardant and other additives is applied to the primary backing to bind a scrim stabilizing layer and a secondary backing layer. Despite their similar construction, carpet products are made with a variety of polymer, filler, and additive content. Yarns are commonly made with Nylon 6 or Nylon 6,6, but may also be made with polyester, typically polyester terephalate (PET). Primary backings are typically a woven polyolefin such as polyester or propylene, but secondary backings widely vary including woven polyolefin, polyurethane and vinyl foams, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), rubber and asphalt. Filler content within the precoat and some secondary backings also vary, including virgin and/or recycled limestone, fly ash (aka. calcium aluminosilicate glass), recycled glass, asphalt, and/or recycled carpet. Fly ash is the most commonly used filler in carpet backings, often bringing heavy metal content such as mercury into the carpet backing. However, the use of fly ash was excluded in this CP for those that specify no fly ash carpeting. Antimicrobial treatments are commonly used as components of the latex precoat, although their efficacy is controversial. Stain treatments are also commonly used across the market, though they are generally proprietary and technologies may be specific to the type of fiber used. Carpets may be installed by direct glue or with factory or site applied peel and stick adhesives. This CP represents a carpet tile made with stain repellant treated nylon 6 fiber, polyolefin backings, and limestone filler."
CP155,Hardwood (prefinished),"This common product describes a solid wood construction with a factory applied finish. Wood flooring is typically 3/4 inch thick and is sold in a variety of shapes and sizes. A variety of domestic and exotic hardwood species may be used to make solid hardwood flooring. Surveys of the North American market show that Red Oak is the dominant species used, making up 70% of the market. Typical factory applied finishes include natural oil finishes or UV cured acrylic finishes. The most commonly used finishes are UV cured urethane acrylate, also referred to as polyurethane, finishes. For additional scratch resistance, these finishes commonly contain aluminum oxide.These finishes are applied in many layers, typically three to ten, in order to provide desired level of protection. Stains and pigments may be applied to the wood prior to the urethane acrylate finish, however that was not covered in this CP."
CP156,Bamboo (engineered),"Bamboo flooring is a composite made up bamboo, typically Moso (Phyllostachys Pubescens) bamboo, a resin, and maybe finished or unfinished. The majority of bamboo used in North America is imported from China. Prior to shipment, bamboo is typically treated with a borate solution via immersion and/or spray for protection from mildew and pests. The flooring may be constructed as a solid plank - strips of bamboo mixed with resin and cured under heat and pressure - or engineered. Engineered bamboo floors are constructed in layers, typically three, of varying orientations, which are bound together with resin. In some cases, the top wear layer is the only bamboo portion and wood makes up the substrate layers. However, it's typical that the wear as well as substrate layers are constructed with bamboo. Formaldehyde based resins remain the most common on the market, however many manufacturers offer No Added Urea Formaldehyde (NAUF) resins, typically phenol formaldehyde resin. A small number of manufacturers offer no added formaldehyde (NAF) resins as standard or optional. NAF resins are typically isocyanate based or a soy flour polyamide-epichlorohydrin (PAE) resin. Bamboo floors are available with a variety of staining colors, but is typically offered natural or carbonized/caramelized, a darker color acheived via heat treatment which caramelizes the sugars in the bamboo. Bamboo flooring is available unfinished, but is more typically sold with a multi-layer UV urethane acrylate finish containing aluminum oxide for added protection and scratch resistance. This CP characterizes a NAUF bamboo floor, constructed of borate treated bamboo fibers throughout with a UV urethane acrylate finish containing aluminum oxide.					"
CP157,Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) (Engineered wood),"Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) is a structural engineered wood panel, which can be used to construct walls, floors, and roofs. CLT panels are prefabricated and are construted to specific building requirements, making them available in a variety of sizes and configurations. CLT panels are constructed in several layers using kiln-dried lumber boards stacked in perpendicular layers, typically three to seven, bound with structural adhesives such as polyurethane, emulsion polymer isocyanate (EPI), melamine, or phenolic adhesives. The commonly specified adhesives are formaldehyde free, such as polyurethane or EPI, the most common being polyurethane."
CP158,PP Water Pipe,"This CP describes pipes made from polypropylene random copolymer (PP-R) that are intended for the distribution of hot and cold water within buildings, and able to sustain a pressure of 160 psi at 73 degrees F, as per ASTM F2389.  While the market for PP-R pipes features a variety of specialty products, we have focused on a “standard” product; that is, no added antimicrobial treatment (more common in Asia than US), and no composite fiberglass reinforcement.  Were any of these options specified for use in construction, the health profile for this CP would likely change considerably."
CP159,PEX Water Pipe,"PEX piping is made from polyethylene that has been crosslinked.  Three major crosslinking methods are used and are designated by the type of PEX: PEX-a (peroxide), PEX-b (silane), and PEX-c (e-beam).  Types a and b are most common and since there is more LCA data available for type a, that type will be highlighted in this CP.  PEX piping is primarily used for radiant heating and domestic cold and hot water applications.  PEX intended to transport of potable water must be evaluated and certified for this purpose.  Applicable standards are ASTM F876, ASTM F877, and NSF/ANSI 14.  Due to possible leachants from the pipe, there are special flushing requirements prior to use.  Some studies indicate that pipe additives and degradation products may be found in water coming from the pipe over extended periods of time.  These leachant materials include antioxidants (and degradants of antioxidants) that are added to PEX to protect it from oxidative degradation as well as degradation from chlorine and hypoclorous acid, often added to potable water to prevent microbial growth.  There is indication of industry movement toward antioxidants with lower leachability such as sulfur containing phenolics and HALS (Uponor,Sahar) but it is unclear to what extent these changes have been implemented. Alternatively, more resistant inner layers can be used in piping, but this does not seem to be the case for standard PEX."
CP160,Pipe Insulation,"Polyethylene pipe insulation is composed of a closed-cell polyethylene foam typically sold in a tube sleeve of varying pipe sizes and thicknesses. The polyethylene foam is produced by extruding polyethylene resin with other additives such as aging modifiers, nucleating agents, pigments and flame retardants. Once mixed, a hydrocarbon blowing agent is injected under high pressure into the extruder and the blended material is pushed through a die at the end of the extruder, forming a tube. Upon exiting the extruder, the blowing agent pressure normalizes, causing the mixed resin to expand. Once the foam cools and solidifies, the insulation can be packaged as an unslit tube, with a slit, or with a slit and pre-applied adhesive. This CP is for a pipe insulation product without a pre-applied adhesive."
CP161,Pipe Insulation Adhesives,"Polyethylene pipe insulation is commonly sliced laterally to make wrapping it around pipes easier.  Once fitted around the pipes, the insulation is glued back together into its original tube shape.  Manufactures generally recommend that the abutting ends of the insulation pieces also be joined together with an adhesive.   This adhesive is based on polychloroprene rubber.  This CP reflects formulation information for the limited products on the market, and is supplemented with information on polychloroprene contact adhesives more generally. Note that these adhesives come in a variety of colors, from light amber to dark black.  We found no particular color to be common so have left coloring agents out of this formulation, but note that they may be present in specific products.				"
CP168,Ready Mixed Concrete (LWC 3000-4000psi),"Like normal weight concrete, structural lightweight concrete is highly customizable in composition.  In general, lightweight concretes rely on lighter aggregates (both course and fine) and can use air entraining admixtures to add substantially more air to the concrete than is typically seen in NWC of the same strength. Depending on the specifications, a portion of the fine lightweight aggregate can be replaced with sand, but this improvement in strength comes at an increase in weight.  This Common Product profile describes the composition of a lightweight 3,000 – 4,000 psi concrete for construction in the San Francisco Bay area."
CP169,"Ready Mix Concrete (BF Slag) (3,000 - 4,000 psi)","Concrete is a common construction material, used in many structural applications, and is highly customizable in composition. Concrete is made by mixing cement, water, sand, and gravel, and can include chemical admixes, alone or in combination, to provide improved strength, durability, or other desired characteristic. This Common Product profile describes an in-situ/ready mix concrete composition likely to be used to produce normal weight 3,000 – 4,000 psi concrete for construction in the San Francisco Bay area, where a Portland-blast furnace slag blended cement (described as Type IS in ASTM C595/C595M) is used in place of a “straight mix”. The exact amounts of all ingredients in concrete will likely vary to some degree based on the contractor, concrete supplier, and the materials used by the supplier to mix the concrete ordered.

The LCA excludes the environmental impacts associated with the use of admixtures, due to the high variation in the amount and type used across concrete mixes. To assess the potential influence this exclusion could have on the impact of the concrete, a scenario analysis was conducted with median amounts of four categories of admixtures: retarding, accelarating (chlorinated), accelerating (non-chlorinated), and water reducing/retarding. Results showed that despite the small contribution by mass (<1%), use of admixtures could increase the environmental burden. Eutrophication potential in paticular was affected, increasing the burden of concrete by as much as 17%. Primary energy demand also increased significantly, up to 7%, while global warming potential showed increases up to 4%."
CP170,"Ready Mix Concrete (Fly Ash) (3,000 - 4,000 psi)","Concrete is a common construction material, used in many structural applications, and is highly customizable in composition. Concrete is made by mixing cement, water, sand, and gravel, and can include chemical admixes, alone or in combination, to provide improved strength, durability, or other desired characteristic. This Common Product profile describes an in-situ/ready mix concrete composition likely to be used to produce normal weight 3,000 – 4,000 psi concrete for construction in the San Francisco Bay area, where a Portland-pozzolon blended cement (described as Type IP in ASTM C595/C595M) is used in place of a “straight mix”. The exact amounts of all ingredients in concrete will likely vary to some degree based on the contractor, concrete supplier, and the materials used by the supplier to mix the concrete ordered.

CP171,Glulam,"Glulam is an engineered wood product made of two or more layers of lumber that are glued together. Multiple formaldehyde resins (Phenol-resorcinol-formaldehyde (PRF), melamine-urea-formaldehyde (MUF), and resorcinol formaldehyde) and polyurethane resins can be used, however PRF resins are the most common on the market and are applicable to interior and exterior applications due to their moisture resistance. Glulam manufacturing begins with kiln-drying lumber (aka lamstock) to a maximum moisture content of 16%. When glulam beams are specified beyond typical lumber sizes, lumber is end jointed and bound with a resin, typically PFR or MUF. Once at the desired length, resin is applied to the lumber faces via cold set (uses pressure and ambient heat) or radio frequency (uses pressure and heat at 200+ degrees Fahrenheit) curing. Glulam may be used for a variety of structural applications in the residential and commercial markets. In applications where the glulam is exposed to weather or high moisture conditions a preservative treatment, such as a copper napthalene treatment, may be needed, but was not included in the scope of this CP. Species resistant to decay and insects, Alaskan Yellow Cedar and Port Oxford Cedar, may also be specified to avoid the use of preservative treatments for glulam. Factory applied sealants and/or plastic wrapping may be use to protect Glulam during transit and construction. Sealants are not standard and are only used when specified. Translucent penetrating sealers may be desired if beams are to be exposed with a stain or natural finish and Primer coats may be specified if a complete seal is desired. Field applied products are also available for these purposes. The CP characterizes an unsealed Glulam product without preservative treatment."
CP172,Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer Decking,"Glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) parts can be used for a variety of construction applications.  This CP focuses on decking material, but due to a lack of information for this specific product, some of the information comes from literature for GFRP parts in general.  Different types of resins can be used depending on the application requirements.  This CP considers unsaturated polyester resin.  Vinyl esters are also common; see CP 176 for information on vinyl ester resins.  For certain applications of GFRP requiring fire ratings, halogenated polyesters and/or mineral flame retardants like antimony oxide and alumina trihydrate may be used; however, they were not found to be common for standard decking materials.  GFRP decking is produced using a pultrusion process.  This is a continuous process used to produce composite parts with a constant cross-sectional profile.  The equipment feeds glass rovings and continuous strand mats into a resin bath.  A surfacing veil is also applied and the pultrusion is pulled through forming/curing dies where polymerization takes place.  At the end of the line, the profile is cut to desired length.  Styrene is generally used as a crosslinking monomer as part of the resin bath.  Some pultruders are making efforts to decrease styrene emission during manufacturing by using lower styrene resins or vapor supressed resins.  This emissions in this CP are based on standard styrene content without vapor suppression.  Residual styrene content in the finished product is very dependent on manufacturing conditions and may vary widely."
CP173,Polycarbonate Cladding,"Polycarbonate panels can be used for a variety of construction applications from visual accents to building cladding.  This CP focuses on those used for cladding, in particular multi-wall panels which could optionally be filled with aerogel for improved insulating properties.  The benefits of polycarbonate over glass are that it is lightweight, has a much higher impact strength, and has improved insulative properties.  The panels have a UV protective layer applied to the exterior side to minimize yellowing due to UV degradation.  There is very little disclosure as to the specific additives used in these types of products.  Stabilizers and mold release agents were found to be common so are included here.  Other additives such as fillers, antistatic agents, flame retardants, etc, are sometimes used in polycarbonate products in general but were not disclosed as used in these products.  Colorants and dyes may optionally be used to alter the appearance of the panels.  As delivered, there is a protective film on both sides of the panel but that was excluded from the scope of this CP due to lack of disclosure regarding its composition.  Some manufacturers offer panels with pre-consumer recycled content (20-40%), although this appears to be more common in Europe and Australia than in the United States."
CP174,Structural Steel Cables,"Structural steel cables can be used for a number of architectural and engineering purposes. They hold up glazed walls and roofs, tensile fabric architecture, suspension bridges, and other architectural features. This survey focused on full-locked structural steel cables; this type of structural steel cable is less flexible than open spiral strand steel cables, but allows for higher loads. The base of full-locked structural steel cables is a round inner core comprising of multiple Galfan-coated carbon steel wires. Outside the inner core Galfan-coated z-profile wires are stranded together to form layers of interlocking wires. As the inner core wires are stranded together during the manufacturing process, a zinc-rich blocking compound or a petrochemical lubricant (and sometimes both) may be used to keep the wires from scraping against each other and as an anti-corrosive agent. For this survey, zinc-rich blocking compounds were found to be more commonly used than petrochemical lubricants. For full-locked cables, ""dry-stranding"" (stranding together the Galfan-coated z-profile wires without lubricant or blocking compound) of the exterior layers was found to be most common."
CP175,Cast Iron Pipes,"“Cast iron” is a generic term for product made by pouring molten iron into molds where the metal is cast in the shape of the mold. Ductile iron pipes are one such cast iron product. Standard industry practice is to use 100% waste scrap iron and steel for these castings, and add a small amount of magnesium, which gives the finished pipe its ductile qualities. The liquid alloy is poured into a centrifugal mold and spun at a high speed to form a pipe of the desired dimension. The metal cools quickly, becoming solid, and is removed from the mold and tempered to increase it strength. Because the bare iron casting is vulnerable to rust, standard practice is to coat all surfaces of the pipe while at the factory. The exterior of the pipe receives a pre-finish of zinc, and an asphaltic coating to seal out moisture and other corrosive elements. Pipes intended to carry sewage or wastewater are coated on the inside with a high alumina cement, a specialty cement resistant to the corrosive properties of these effluents. (Pipes carrying potable water would be lined with a standard Portland cement). The asphaltic coating used on the pipe exterior can also be applied to the interior of the pipe walls if water chemistries necessitate an additional protective layer. Depending on soil characteristics (pH, permeability, etc), the pipes can be installed below grade with a protective polyethylene sleeve surrounding the pipe."
CP176,Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer Water Storage Tank,"Fiberglass Reinforced Polymer (FRP) storage tanks are used to store a variety of liquids and come in many different shapes and sizes depending upon the application. Additionally, FRP fittings such as pipe connections and manways may also be necessary. For this CP, the scope was limited to single-walled, underground storage tanks. Fittings were not included since they are highly customizable and to simplify the geometry for calculations. Applications for FRP water tanks include the storage of potable water, storm water runoff, greywater, rain water, and water for back-up fire supression systems. FRP tanks are constructed of multiple layers of fiberglass and binder, which may be a vinyl ester polyester, as modeled in this CP, or unsaturated polyester resins; see CP 172 for information on unsaturated polyester resins. Fiberglass reinforcements included in this CP are surfacing veils, chopped strand mat, woven roving, and continuous strand roving. FRP tanks are constructed as a multi-layered laminate, made in three main pieces: the cylindrical tank form, commonly made using the filament winding process and two head pieces, constructed via contact molding or hand lay-up process. Both processes start by applying a surfacing veil, the most common being one made of woven c-glass, and saturating it with resin. This layer is typically resin rich in order to create a corrosion resistant layer. For additional corrosion resistance, a layer, commonly referred to as the corrosion layer, is added on top of the surface layer. The corrosion layer is composed of at least two layers of chopped strand mat saturated with resin. The structural layer is applied next. Structural layers vary by thickness depending upon the desired stregth of the FRP composite. In the filament winding process, which is done mechanically, the structural layer is made using continuous strand roving which is saturated just prior to application. Contact molded laminates have a structural layer made of alternating layers of resin saturated chopped strand mat and woven roving. The last 2-3 mils of the structural layer include a small amount of paraffin wax to create a top coat that helps surfaces exposed to the air cure properly. Once the laminate pieces have hardened, the heads are joined to the tank form with additional laminate overlay at the joint. The overlay includes a surfacing layer, corrosion layer, and paraffin top coat. The constructed tank undergoes additional curing and may undergo more stringent curing processes to remove more styrene residual from the tank interior surface."
CP177,Gypsum Spray Fireproofing,"Gypsum spray fireproofing is applied to structural steel beams, columns, joists, and floor and roof decking to insulate it from high heat produced during a fire and to prevent (or delay) the loss of structural integrity.  It is sold in dry mix bags which are then mixed together on site with potable water and sprayed onto un-primed steel. The wet mix density and spray rate must be carefully controlled so that a minimum dry density of 15 pcf (240 kg/m3) is achieved. Gypsum spray fireproofing is applied after all construction work on the application area is completed in order to limit disturbance to the set material. However, ducts, piping, and conduit must be installed after fireproofing has been completed."
CP178,Laminated Glass,"Laminated glass is composed of two sheets of glass with a thin adhesive interlayer between.  The benefits of laminated glass compared to a solid glass pane are penetration resistance (it is more difficult to break through), safety (broken shards of glass are held together by the interlayer), sound reduction, and UV protection.  Polyvinyl butyral (PVB) has been the dominant interlayer material since the late 1930’s and remains the most commonly used film in laminated glass. Laminated glass is produced by sandwiching the PVB layer between pieces of glass and applying heat and pressure.  The PVB interlayer generally contains a plasticizer to decrease the PVB stiffness and a UV absorber to improve the UV protection of the film.  Some specialty films with increased strength or improved acoustic performance have been developed, but a standard type film was investigated here.  Various types of glass can be used for laminated glass.  An ultraclear, low iron glass is included here - the reduced iron content gives the glass a clearer (less green) appearance than standard glass. The glass may contain 0-20% post-industrial recycled glass from in-plant recycling."
CP179,Fiberglass Board Insulation,"Fiber glass board insulation liner is used to insulate the insides of metal heating and cooling ductwork or plenums. In addition to providing thermal insulation in areas where the carried air is cooler or warmer than the ambient air surrounding the ductwork, fiber glass board insulation liner also provides acoustical insulation, damping the noise of the HVAC system as well as cutting down on cross-talk. Fiberglass  board insulation is made up of a fiber base held together by a binder. This substrate is then covered with a mat of densely-packed continuous filiament glass fibers and an acrylic coating; together this is known as air stream surfacing. This air stream surfacing protects the surface of the fiber glass board exposed to airflow in the duct, protecting it from damage and moisture. Fiber glass board insulation is affixed to the metal ductwork or plenum using both an adhesive and mechanical fasteners which are outside of the scope of this CP."
CP180,PMMA Countertop,"Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) or acrylic solid surface countertops are countertops made from a manmade polymer. These countertops are cured in sheet form and can be cut or formed to a number of different shapes and layouts. Sheets can be joined with a polymer adhesive to achieve a ""seamless"" look. Because PMMA countertops are nonporous, they are stain-resistant and do not require sealing. PMMA countertops come in a rainbow of colors and effects; however, white countertops were the focus of this survey. The pigments used to make other colors may have different associated health hazards."
